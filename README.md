# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The goal of this analysis was to apply machine learning to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by "Alphabet Soup"

## Results:
The results after three attempts of optimication were as follows:

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
